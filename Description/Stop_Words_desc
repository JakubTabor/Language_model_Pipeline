# In this exercise i gonna be working with stop words 
* First i load **small model in english, which i assign to nlp** and put a **text into nlp object, i assign it doc**
* Then i **call functionality is_stop, it means that if token is stop word**, then do something   
* And we print this stop words tokens, **they don't add any new context to the meaning of given text**

# Next i create preprocess function, which take given text and remove all stop words
* In list comprehension i define that **if token from given text is not stop word and punctuation**, it says that we don't want this type of tokens
* And then we align them and convert into string instead of list
