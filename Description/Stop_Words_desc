# In this exercise i gonna be working with stop words 
* First i load **small model in english, which i assign to nlp** and put a **text into nlp object, i assign it doc**
* Then i **call functionality is_stop, it means that if token is stop word**, then do something   
* And we print this stop words tokens, **they don't add any new context to the meaning of given text**

# Next i create preprocess function, which take given text and remove all stop words
* In list comprehension i define that **if token from given text is not stop word and punctuation**, it says that we don't want this type of tokens
* And then we align them and convert into string instead of list
* And we see that all stop words are moved, we get pure informations

# I load dataset, which contain informations and i take only this with topic, rest i ignore
* And i **apply my preprocess function on 4 row, column contents**
* Number of words are changed from **5504 to 4217**

# Next i gonna create function which count number of stop words in the given text and return their percentage
* I start from setting 2 variables for counts (total and percentage) to zero
