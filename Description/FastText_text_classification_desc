# [Example 3: FastText text classification](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Language_model_Pipeline/blob/main/FastText_Text_Classification.ipynb)
# In this example i gonna use Ecommerce dataset to classify products
* I start from preprocessing, so i droping duplicated rows, simplified the labels and make it more visible 
* Then i create function that use regular expressions to clean text from signs
* Make the lower cases and make the text clear and readable
* Then i take the merge column with (label and description of the product) and use on it preprocess function
# Now when my text is preprocess and clear i can create train and test sets
* And i convert it into a format that is proper for the fasttext model
