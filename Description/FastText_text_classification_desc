# [Example 3: FastText text classification](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Language_model_Pipeline/blob/main/FastText_Text_Classification.ipynb)
# In this example i gonna use Ecommerce dataset to classify products
* I start from preprocessing, so i droping duplicated rows, simplified the labels and make it more visible 
* Then i create function that use regular expressions to clean text from signs

* Make the lower cases and make the text clear and readable
* Then i take the merge column with (label and description of the product) and use on it preprocess function
# Now when my text is preprocess and clear i can create train and test sets
* And i convert it into a format that is proper for the fasttext model

* Then i train and test the model, score that i achieve is high
# Next i put some phrases into the model for predictions
* From the descriptions of predict it return the label of product and certainty score
![](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Language_model_Pipeline/blob/main/Images_fastText_classification/model_prediction.png)
* All predictions are correct and certainty score is high, so the model is well behaved and very certain
* I also call my model to return me the most similar words to given word
* It return words from the patterns that it learned with certainty score
