# [Example 1: Language processing in spacy](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Language_model_Pipeline/blob/main/Language_Processing_Pipeline_Spacy.ipynb)
# I use spacy to first tokenize and then describe each part of token
* I also put full phrases that contain different part of speech (LOC, MONEY, GPE, DATE...)
* Next i check if it woark in different languages (Epanish)
