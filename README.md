# [Example 2: Word embeddings in spacy](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Language_model_Pipeline/blob/main/spacy_word_embeddings_excercise.ipynb)
# I use pure python to first tokenize and then convert text and classes into numerical form
* Text is first preprocess, it mean that it change to simplified version
